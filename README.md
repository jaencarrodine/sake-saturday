This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Chat UI password protection

The `/chat` UI now requires a password gate with two access levels:

- `CHAT_UI_GENERAL_PASSWORD`: unlocks general chat access (including tasting creation tools)
- `CHAT_UI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: unlocks admin privileges (same elevated tool access as Jaen's number on WhatsApp)
- `CHAT_UI_SESSION_SECRET`: signing secret for secure chat session cookies

If `CHAT_UI_SESSION_SECRET` is not set, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is used as a fallback.

After unlocking chat, users are prompted for a phone number before sending messages.
That phone identity links web chat to the same Sake Sensei agent pipeline and context model
used by WhatsApp.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
